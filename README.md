### Product aim of the study: 
to investigate whether there are any limitations in the mobile network characteristics which reduce the satisfaction level of its users. 

### Tasks: 
* to explore if the characteristics of the network are different for satisfied and non-satisfied customers;
* to explore, if there is any difference in the characteristics of the network of the customers, who are not satisfied with the quality of the service and mention some precise limitations of it. 

### To accomplish the research, I have performed:
* exploratory data analysis;
* comparisons of groups according to:
their general estimation of the network,
their mentioning the limitations of the network;
* exploration of the featuresâ€™ distribution in the groups of customers;
* statistical analysis of differences in those features among different groups of customers according to their estimation of the network, including:
Kruskal-Wallis test,
bootstrap.

### Results show 
there is no statistical difference in the network features between different groups of customers according their network estimation, besides just two features and even those are statistically different only if we compare groups according to their general estimation of the network.
